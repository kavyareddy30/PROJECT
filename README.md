A modular Java application that serves as a centralized launcher (Main Hub) for three independent programs:
Data Structures Calculator – A command-line utility to perform and visualize various data structure operations (like stacks, queues, trees, etc.).
Console-based CRUD Application – A terminal-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app for managing records using standard input/output.
JavaFX GUI CRUD Application – A graphical CRUD system with a user-friendly interface built using JavaFX, integrated with Oracle Database via JDBC.
The hub allows users to select and run any of these modules interactively from a single entry point.
